#FastFoodChooser
Created: 03/13/2008

This is a small utility I created because I have a hard time deciding where to eat when I do not feel like cooking
food at home. It randomly chooses from a list of fast food restaurants in the Mesa, AZ area. This zip file
includes an MSI install and a setup.exe installer. It is also listed on the Software Informer webiste at
http://fast-food-chooser.software.informer.com.
